###---<readme.txt CommandNotebooks/>---###  (CommandNotebook = CN)

All command notebooks are stored here, and symlinked to the respective location given by itself name.

We do not have to worry about the location of original *.ipynb files , because all those commands are referred to the "current working directory" in which the link is (cwd). This way we can store and tar *.ipynb more easily.


###----------------------!!!NOTE!!!-------------------------###
Do not run any of this folder CNs because they simply don't work here , and may cause a problem in the filesystem.

If any of them causes issues, just copy manually the correspondent one to location.
