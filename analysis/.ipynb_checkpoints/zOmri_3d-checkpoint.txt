###---<Correo Omri 3D classification>---###
(<Marc>)
Alvaro,

Aquí tienes una explicación de como hacer la conversión del catálogo de Omry a pixels en las imágenes.

Los catálogos hay que leerlos con numpy para que tengan sentido.

> The sunrise images also provide the camera up direction, namely the y axis. The x-axis is computed as the cross product between y and z.
> Basically, you can ignore the z value. The x,y values tell you where the clump is in the sunrise image, in physical units. I convert them to pixels using the formula I gave you.
