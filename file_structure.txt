#Originally, the files of the weight "unet....best.hd5" and "unet.py" were in this parent_dir, but were moved to "python_work/"

##--<WORK>--## 
#--python_work/(original_files)--#
	unet.py : Trained UNET model 
	unet_48000_10_31_18_CT_48000_09_18_18_best.hd5 : Weights of the trained UNET model 

#--python_work/(my_files)--#
	sys_params.py : Load system parameters as user, parent directory, python directory ,data directory ,backups, extensions and so on... 
	data_notation.py : Charge differents flow strings to work much easier with the data. All data in those 5 folders are in the same notation and follows the same patterns. #- noise.py : Change zeropoint of images (depend on filter) and add a randomized noise from flat "noise_stamps/" images.
